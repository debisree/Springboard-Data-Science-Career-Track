    "\n",
    "Online recommendation systems are the ‚Äòin‚Äô thing to do for many e-commerce websites. A recommendation system broadly recommends products to customers best suited to their tastes and traits. This project is focused around building various kinds of book recommendation engines; namely the Simple Generic Recommender, the Content-Based Filter and the User-Based Collaborative Filter. The performance of the systems will be evaluated in both a qualitative and quantitative manner.\n",

    "* 49.9% of the tag-IDs are used more than once. So, referred tham as 'popular' and 50.1% of the tag-IDs are used just once. So referred then as 'Non popular'.\n",
    "* In 'tags.csv' 34252 unique tag IDs are out there and 34252 tag names are there.\n",
    "* Merged the above two datasets on 'Tag-ID' using the 'merge' function of Pandas dataframe. The top 3 most used tags are **\"to-read\"**, **\"favorites\"**, and **\"owned\"**.\n",
    "* In 'to_read.csv' 9986 book IDs are out there.\n",
    "* Book-ID no. 47 is the most demanded book, enlisted 2772 times. Followed by the Book-ID no. 143 (1967 times).\n",
    "* 48871 unique user-IDs are there. User-ID '38457' is the popular one, enlisted 117 times. Followed by the user-ID '28259' (114 times).\n",

    "* Least popular (2.1%) rating is '1'\n",
    "* 20% of users have an average rating which is less than 3.5 stars. This could suggest that the readers like reading and have a positive bias towards books in general.\n",
    "\n",
    "* 80% of the users vary their ratings by 1 stars. For example, a user might always give books 4-star or 5-star ratings. Another might only give out 2-star or 3-star ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "* In books.csv, 10000 rows and 23 columns (features) are there. best_book_id', 'work_id','isbn13','image_url', 'small_image_url' - these five columns are of no use in context to the analysis. So dropped them.\n",

    "* There are 31 books with negative publication year! and 21 books have missing value for the publication year.\n",
    "* Year of publication does not have much correlation with the average rating.\n",

    "* The oldest publication year listed = -1750! and the newest publication year listed = 2017.\n",
    "* 585 book titles are missing!\n",
    "* Some titles are common (eg. There are 5 different books titled 'The Gift'). **'The Gift'** and **'Twilight'** are the most popular titles. (Each of them are the titles of 5 different books.)\n",
    "* More than 70% of the books are 'English'\n",
    "* The mean of average_rating obtained by each book is 4.002\n",
    "* Most books in this dataset (~90%) have been reviewed between 10,000 and 100,000 times. The mean is = 59687.32. So each book has been rated on an average 59687 times.\n",

    "* The average rating for a book does not strongly correlate with the no. of ratings, or with the number of written reviews obtained. Where as, there is a strong relationship between the no. of ratings and the no. of written reviews. So, more often a book is rated, more likely it is to receive a written review.\n",
    "\n",
    "* None of the numeric features in this dataset have a strong correlation with the average book rating.\n",
    "* A user is more likely write a review (written review) if they are rating the book with 4 stars.\n",
    "* The strongest indicator of a low average rating is the presence of 2-star ratings. Mathematically, we might expect that a 1-star rating would bring the average down more. However, 2-star ratings are less common than 1-star ratings, which might make them more significant. With a 0.116 correlation, it's still a fairly weak predictor.\n",
    "* 5-star ratings have the next strongest correlation to average rating.\n",
    "* **The Hunger Games** got the maximum no. of reviews by the users.\n",
    "* **The Complete Calvin and Hobbes** got the highest average rating (4.82) by the users.\n",
    "* **The Hunger Games** got the maximum no. of written reviews by the users.\n",
