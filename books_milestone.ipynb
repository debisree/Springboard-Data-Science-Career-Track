    "Online recommendation systems are the ‘in’ thing to do for many e-commerce websites. A recommendation system broadly recommends products to customers best suited to their tastes and traits. This project is focused around building various kinds of book recommendation engines; namely the Simple Generic Recommender, the Content-Based Filter and the User-Based Collaborative Filter. The performance of the systems will be evaluated in both a qualitative and quantitative manner.\n",
